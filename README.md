## Groovy Advent of Code solutions

These are my solutions for the *Advent of Code 2022* puzzles, written in Groovy.
No guarantee that I will reach day 25...

Prerequisites: Java installed, Groovy installed (see https://groovy-lang.org/), 
environment variable `GROOVY_HOME` set to installation directory.

Run `./aoc <year> <n>` to execute script for day *n* in *year*, use leading zero for days < 10, e.g. `./aoc 2022 06`.
